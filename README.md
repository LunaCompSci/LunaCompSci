### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**LunaCompSci/LunaCompSci** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Right now my intended major is pre-med, microbiology, biology, bioengineering with data science option or bioinformatics at UW and NSC. Those majors are listed from first choice to last choice. I'm not sure what major(s) exactly yet. I want to be an infectious disease doctor, pathologist, or geneticist/genetics counselor. I have more interest in research than clinic, but I don't like the pay.

I used to study computer science in college, but switched because I didn't love it enough and was bad at it. It was my 3rd interest and I mainly studied it for the money. There's a low chance I'll study CS again, and if I do, it'll be self-taught front-end or data science. I'm more likely to self-teach UI/UX though because it's visual.

- Technologies I know well: Java (up to CSC142), HTML, Python, Git, R
- Technologies I kind of know: Javascript, CSS, Mathematica
- 
- Technologies I want to learn (in order of priority): Bioinformatics, Data Science, Front-end Dev, UI/UX design (Figma), Machine Learning & Neural Networks, Rust, & React!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all the technologies listed above. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics projects and me doing the front-end of projects! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://linktr.ee/artdensity tina200211@gmail.com
- I do have some web programming and R programming projects but because they're university projects I can't post them on GitHub due to code plagiarism. Also, I withdrew by week 7 of my web programming class and have yet to learn all the content that I missed.
