- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all the technologies listed above.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://linktr.ee/artdensity tina200211@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- I do have some web programming projects but because they're university projects I can't post them on GitHub due to code plagiarism. Also, I withdrew by week 7 and have yet to learn all the content that I missed.  
If I continue to learn CS, it'll probably be self-study and not through a college. There's a small chance I'll continue to learn CS through college.
